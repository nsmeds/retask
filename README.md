## Retask

A simple to-do application built with React. Users can add, edit and delete items, as well as mark items as complete and toggle between viewing complete and incomplete items. The default view shows all items. List data is persisted on refresh via localStorage. 

To install, clone this repo, `cd` into the directory and run `npm start` to start the development server.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
