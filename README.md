## Retask

A simple to-do application built with React. Users can add, edit and delete items, as well as mark items as complete and toggle between viewing complete and incomplete items. The default view shows all items. List data is persisted on refresh via localStorage. 

To install, clone this repo and `cd` into the repo directory. Run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm start` to start the development server.

A live version of the app is at [https://nsmeds.github.io/retask].

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
